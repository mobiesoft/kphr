  providing exceptional HR solutions for small businesses in California.
heading: Expert HR Solutions for California Businesses
intro: >-
  KPHR brings over a decade of HR experience supporting California startups,
  established companies, and international businesses entering the California
  market. We help organizations build compliant, people-first teams through
  targeted HR services, including payroll, employee handbooks, benefits
  administration, health insurance evaluation, and employee onboarding and off
  boarding.


  For many small and growing businesses, a full-time, in-house HR professional
  is not always practical or cost-effective. KPHR’s fractional HR services are
  designed to deliver maximum value by focusing on the services businesses need
  most, when they need them.


  To further support our clients, we provide a library of free compliance and
  best-practice training videos. These resources help owners, office managers,
  and warehouse managers understand and apply California employment
  requirements, reducing risk and helping organizations stay compliant and
  protected from legal exposure.
tagline: Bilingual. Practical. People-centered.

# What Is SB 1343?

SB 1343 amended California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The law requires sexual harassment prevention training for:

•Supervisors: At least 2 hours, every two years


•Non-supervisory employees: At least 1 hour, every two years


Previously, training only applied to companies with 50+ employees and focused on supervisors (under AB 1825). SB 1343 reflects California’s commitment to protecting workers in smaller businesses and aligns with the #MeToo movement’s goal of creating safe workplaces.

# Who Must Comply?

### Covered Employers

•Private and public employers with five or more employees (including part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees)


•Most non-profit organizations


•Employees must work in California (including those temporarily remote)


Note: Interns and volunteers count toward the five-employee threshold but do not require training unless performing work similar to employees.

# Training Requirements

### Supervisors

•Duration: 2 hours


•Frequency: Every 2 years


•New hires: Within 6 months of assuming a supervisory role


### Non-Supervisory Employees

# What Does “Exempt” vs. “Non-Exempt” Mean?
The terms exempt and non-exempt primarily refer to whether an employee is exempt from overtime pay and certain wage-and-hour protections under labor laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state laws.

## Non-Exempt Employees
Non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime pay and must be paid at least the minimum wage.

### Key characteristics:
•Eligible for overtime (typically 1.5× pay for hours over 40 per week)


•Paid hourly or sometimes salaried (salary alone does not make someone exempt)


•Time worked must be accurately tracked


•Protected by most wage-and-hour rules

### Common roles:
 Customer service representatives, administrative staff, retail employees, warehouse workers, technicians
 
## Exempt Employees
Exempt employees are not eligible for overtime pay if they meet specific legal requirements.

### Key characteristics:
•Paid on a salary basis


•Meet a minimum salary threshold


•Perform specific job duties defined by law


•Not entitled to overtime pay

### Common roles:
 Managers, executives, certain professionals (lawyers, doctors), administrative leaders, specialized IT professionals
 
## The Three Tests for Exempt Classification
To classify an employee as exempt, all three tests must be met:
### 1. Salary Basis Test
The employee must receive a fixed salary that does not fluctuate based on hours worked.
### 2. Salary Level Test
The employee must earn at least the minimum salary required by law, which may vary by jurisdiction and can change over time.
### 3. Duties Test

The employee’s primary job duties must fall into an exempt category, such as:
•Executive


•Administrative


•Professional


•Certain computer or outside sales roles


Failing any one of these tests means the employee must be classified as non-exempt.

## Why Proper Classification Matters

### Legal Compliance
Misclassification is one of the most common employment law violations. Consequences may include:
•Back pay for unpaid overtime


•Penalties and interest


•Government audits


•Class-action lawsuits


## HR Strategy
Correct classification helps:
•Control labor costs


•Set clear expectations around work hours


•Support accurate workforce planning


•Avoid burnout and morale issues


## Employee Relations
Employees who feel misclassified may:

•Lose trust in leadership


•Experience wage dissatisfaction


•File complaints or legal claims


Transparency and fairness in classification strengthen employee engagement and retention.
Common Misclassification Mistakes
•Assuming salaried = exempt


•Giving a managerial title without managerial duties


•Not updating classifications after role changes


•Ignoring state-specific labor laws


•Failing to track hours for non-exempt salaried employees

## Best Practices for Employers
•Conduct regular job classification audits


•Review actual job duties—not job titles


•Stay updated on federal and state labor law changes


•Train managers on overtime and timekeeping rules


•Document classification decisions clearly

When in doubt, consult an HR professional or employment law expert.

## Final Thoughts
Understanding the difference between exempt and non-exempt employees isn’t just about compliance—it’s about building a fair, transparent, and sustainable workplace. Proper classification protects your business, supports your HR strategy, and promotes positive employee relations.
If you’re unsure whether your employees are classified correctly, now is the time to review—before a problem arises.

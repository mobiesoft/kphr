What Does “Exempt” vs. “Non-Exempt” Mean?
The terms exempt and non-exempt primarily refer to whether an employee is exempt from overtime pay and certain wage-and-hour protections under labor laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state laws.
Non-Exempt Employees
Non-exempt employees are entitled to overtime pay and must be paid at least the minimum wage.
Key characteristics:
Eligible for overtime (typically 1.5× pay for hours over 40 per week)


Paid hourly or sometimes salaried (salary alone does not make someone exempt)


Time worked must be accurately tracked


Protected by most wage-and-hour rules
Common roles:
 Customer service representatives, administrative staff, retail employees, warehouse workers, technicians
Exempt Employees
Exempt employees are not eligible for overtime pay if they meet specific legal requirements.
Key characteristics:
Paid on a salary basis


Meet a minimum salary threshold


Perform specific job duties defined by law


Not entitled to overtime pay
Common roles:
 Managers, executives, certain professionals (lawyers, doctors), administrative leaders, specialized IT professionals
The Three Tests for Exempt Classification
To classify an employee as exempt, all three tests must be met:
1. Salary Basis Test
The employee must receive a fixed salary that does not fluctuate based on hours worked.
2. Salary Level Test
The employee must earn at least the minimum salary required by law, which may vary by jurisdiction and can change over time.
3. Duties Test
The employee’s primary job duties must fall into an exempt category, such as:
Executive


Administrative


Professional


Certain computer or outside sales roles


Failing any one of these tests means the employee must be classified as non-exempt.
Why Proper Classification Matters
Legal Compliance
Misclassification is one of the most common employment law violations. Consequences may include:
Back pay for unpaid overtime


Penalties and interest


Government audits


Class-action lawsuits


HR Strategy
Correct classification helps:
Control labor costs


Set clear expectations around work hours


Support accurate workforce planning


Avoid burnout and morale issues


Employee Relations
Employees who feel misclassified may:
Lose trust in leadership


Experience wage dissatisfaction


File complaints or legal claims


Transparency and fairness in classification strengthen employee engagement and retention.
Common Misclassification Mistakes
Assuming salaried = exempt


Giving a managerial title without managerial duties


Not updating classifications after role changes


Ignoring state-specific labor laws


Failing to track hours for non-exempt salaried employees
Best Practices for Employers
Conduct regular job classification audits


RB eview actual job duties—not job titles


Stay updated on federal and state labor law changes


Train managers on overtime and timekeeping rules


Document classification decisions clearly
When in doubt, consult an HR professional or employment law expert.

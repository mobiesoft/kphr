# Timing Is Everything: California’s Golden Rule

California law differentiates final wage timing based on how employment ends.

### 1. Terminated Employees

If you fire or lay off an employee, you must provide their final paycheck immediately at termination.

The final paycheck must include:

•All wages earned through the last day


•Accrued and unused vacation or PTO


•Earned commissions and bonuses


•Outstanding expense reimbursements


Pro tip: Prepare checks or ensure same-day electronic payment capabilities for planned and unplanned terminations.

### 2. Employees Who Quit

Timing depends on the notice provided:

•72+ Hours Notice: Pay all earned wages, including accrued vacation, on the last day of work.


•Less Than 72 Hours Notice: Pay all wages within 72 hours of quitting. The clock starts when the employee resigns.


Exception: If the employee requests payment by mail, the mailing date counts as the payment date—but only if mailed within 72 hours.

### 3. Special Industry Exceptions

Certain industries have unique rules:

•Seasonal agricultural workers: 72 hours after layoff


•Motion picture employees: Next regular payday


•Oil drilling layoffs: 24 hours (excluding weekends/holidays)


•Union employees in live theater/concerts: Per collective bargaining agreements



# What Must Be Included in the Final Paycheck

California law requires inclusion of:

•Regular wages, overtime, and double-time hours


•Accrued vacation or PTO (if your policy provides it)


•Earned commissions and bonuses


•Expense reimbursements


•Unpaid meal/rest break premiums (if violations occurred)


Exclusions: Paid sick leave is not required unless promised by company policy.

# What Cannot Be Withheld

Employers cannot delay or condition final wages for:

•Unreturned company property (phones, computers, uniforms)


•Signing separation agreements


•Repayment of loans


•Alleged damages to equipment (except in limited circumstances)


### Permissible deductions:

•Standard tax withholdings


•Court-ordered garnishments/child support


•Property damage due to gross negligence or theft



# Waiting Time Penalties: Why Delays Are Costly

California enforces timely payment through waiting time penalties, which accrue daily at the employee’s full daily rate for up to 30 calendar days.

### Key points:

•Penalties accrue even on weekends and holidays


•Maximum exposure: 30 days of wages


•Applies when the employer willfully fails to pay, which includes accidental delays under the employer’s control


## Examples

### Example 1 – Fired Manager:

•Daily wage: $200


•Final paycheck 15 days late


•Penalty: $3,000


### Example 2 – Retail Worker:

•Daily wage: $144


•Final paycheck 16 days late


•Penalty: $2,304


### Example 3 – Salaried Employee:

•Daily wage: $288.46


•Final paycheck never provided (45 days later)


•Penalty: $8,653.80 (capped at 30 days)



# The Good Faith Dispute Exception

A good faith dispute can prevent penalties if the employer can demonstrate:

•A reasonable disagreement about wages owed


•Legal or factual basis backed by evidence


### What doesn’t qualify:

•Disagreements without evidence


•Payroll or administrative issues


•Arguments in bad faith


Note: Any undisputed wages must still be paid immediately.

# Real Costs of Non-Compliance

### Direct costs:

•Unpaid wages


•Waiting time penalties


•Attorney’s fees


•Court costs and interest


### Indirect costs:

•Management time


•Increased insurance premiums


•Regulatory scrutiny


•Reputational damage


Multiplier effect: Multiple affected employees can exponentially increase financial exposure.

# Best Practices for Employers

### 1. Create a Clear Final Paycheck Procedure


•Assign responsibilities and backup plans


•Document calculation and payment steps


### 2. Maintain Accurate Vacation/PTO Records


•Use payroll software for accrual tracking


•Verify balances before termination


### 3. Prepare Checks in Advance


•For planned terminations, prepare wages and bonuses ahead of time


### 4. Establish Emergency Payment Capabilities


•Keep blank checks


•Ensure same-day electronic payment


### 5. Train Management Teams


•Ensure managers understand immediate payment and 72-hour rules


### 6. Use Clear Vacation/PTO Policies


•Written policies prevent disputes


•Include accrual, caps, and termination calculation rules


### 7. Document Everything


•Keep records of termination/resignation dates, paycheck issuance, and disputes


### 8. Pay Promptly in Case of Doubt


•Pay undisputed amounts immediately


•Escrow disputed amounts while consulting legal counsel



# Conclusion

California’s final paycheck laws are strict but clear:

•Immediate payment for terminations


•Within 72 hours for resignations


•Waiting time penalties accrue daily, up to 30 days


For small and medium-sized businesses, compliance is critical. Implementing proper procedures, training managers, and paying promptly protects your company from penalties, legal fees, and reputational damage.
Bottom line: When it comes to final wages in California, on time is the only acceptable time.

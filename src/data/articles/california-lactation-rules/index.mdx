  baseline, California law goes significantly further, imposing additional
  obligations related to space, duration, policies, and enforcement.


  If you employ workers in California, understanding these enhanced protections
  is critical—not only to stay compliant, but to support employee retention and
  reduce legal risk.

# The Federal Baseline: What the PUMP Act Requires
The Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act, effective December 2022, amended the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). It requires employers of all sizes to provide:

•Reasonable break time to express breast milk


•A private, non-bathroom space shielded from view and free from intrusion


•Coverage for up to one year after a child’s birth


•Protections for nearly all employees, including salaried workers


Employers with fewer than 50 employees may claim an undue hardship exemption, but this exception is narrow and difficult to prove.

## How California Lactation Laws Go Beyond Federal Requirements
California Labor Code Sections 1030–1034 provide stronger and more detailed protections than federal law. Employers must comply with both, but when laws differ, California’s stricter standard applies.
### 1. No Time Limit on Lactation Accommodations
Federal law: Up to one year after childbirth
California law: No time limit
California employers must provide lactation accommodations for as long as the employee needs to express milk, regardless of the child’s age.

### 2. Stricter Lactation Room Requirements
California law requires more than just privacy. A compliant lactation space must:

•Be close to the employee’s work area


•Be shielded from view and free from intrusion


•Be safe, clean, and free of hazardous materials


Include:


  ‣A seat


  ‣A surface for pumping equipment and personal items


  ‣Access to electricity for breast pumps


Employers must also provide nearby access to:

•A sink with running water


•A refrigerator suitable for storing breast milk (or a cooler if refrigeration is not feasible)


•A bathroom—even a private one—never qualifies.

### 3. Mandatory Written Lactation Accommodation Policy
California requires employers to maintain a written lactation accommodation policy that includes:

•Employees’ right to request accommodation


•The process for making a request


•The employer’s obligation to respond


•The right to file a complaint with the Labor Commissioner


Distribution Requirements:

•Include in employee handbooks


•Provide to new hires upon onboarding


•Distribute when employees inquire about or take parental leave



### 4. Stronger Enforcement and Penalties
California provides multiple enforcement avenues:

•One hour of pay at the employee’s regular rate per violation


•Civil penalties of $100 per violation


•Potential claims for sex discrimination or retaliation


•Complaints filed with the Labor Commissioner or BOFE


Noncompliance can quickly become costly—especially if violations are ongoing.

### 5. Explicit Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Retaliation Protections
Under California law, breastfeeding and lactation are protected characteristics.
Employers may not:

•Deny promotions or opportunities


•Discipline employees for taking lactation breaks


•Create a hostile environment


•Retaliate against employees who request accommodation


•Violations may support claims under California’s Fair Employment and Housing laws.

Special Workplace Situations: Flexible Compliance Options
California law allows flexibility without reducing employee protections:

•Multi-purpose rooms: Allowed, but lactation use must take priority


•Shared lactation spaces: Permitted in multi-tenant buildings


•Temporary spaces: Allowed if compliant and near work areas


•Agricultural worksites: Enclosed, shaded spaces (including vehicle cabs) may qualify


•Multi-employer worksites: General contractors must coordinate accommodation access



## Break Time Requirements: What Counts as “Reasonable”?
California requires:

•Breaks each time the employee needs to express milk


•Alignment with paid breaks when possible


•Unpaid time if not concurrent with paid breaks


•Travel time to and from the lactation space excluded from break time


Best practice:

•2–3 pumping breaks during an 8-hour shift


•15–30 minutes per session, depending on individual needs


If an employee pumps during paid breaks, that time must be paid.

## Undue Hardship: A Very High Standard
Small employers may claim undue hardship, but enforcement agencies apply this exception very narrowly.
What typically does not qualify:

•Minor inconvenience


•Scheduling challenges


•Sharing rooms


•Temporary space adjustments


Most employers can comply using creative, low-cost solutions.

## Step-by-Step Compliance Guide for Employers

### Step 1: Audit Your Workplace
Identify compliant lactation spaces that are private, accessible, and safe.
### Step 2: Create a Written Policy
Ensure your policy meets all statutory requirements.
### Step 3: Distribute Widely
Include in handbooks, onboarding, intranet, and leave discussions.
### Step 4: Train Managers
Managers must understand:

•Employee rights


•Privacy obligations


•Scheduling accommodations


•Anti-retaliation rules


### Step 5: Respond Promptly
Acknowledge requests quickly, document accommodations, and follow up.

## Common California Lactation Compliance Mistakes

❌ Providing only a bathroom


❌ Requiring medical documentation


❌ Automatically limiting accommodation to one year


❌ Failing to create a written policy


❌ Locating rooms too far from work areas


❌ Inadequate privacy controls


❌ No sink or refrigeration access



## Why Lactation Accommodation Makes Business Sense
Beyond compliance, strong lactation support delivers measurable benefits:

•Higher employee retention


•Reduced absenteeism


•Improved morale and engagement


•Stronger employer brand


•Lower risk of discrimination claims


Supporting lactating employees is not just a legal obligation—it’s a strategic investment.

## Final Thoughts
California’s lactation accommodation laws reflect a clear policy choice: working parents deserve meaningful, practical support. Employers who proactively comply not only avoid penalties but also build a workplace culture rooted in respect, equity, and retention.
By aligning your policies, spaces, and training with California’s enhanced standards, you protect your business while supporting employees during a critical stage of life.
In today’s competitive labor market, that commitment is a powerful advantage.
